#Kannywoodtv Mobile App Project

Install modules:
```npm install``` or ```yarn install``` (note ```yarn``` does a better job at installing dependencies on macOS)

To run, do:
```
npx react-native run-android
```
or
```
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 8 Plus"
```

NOTE: In some cases, the abovementioned procedure leads to the error 'Failed to load bundle - Could not connect to development server'. In these cases, kill all other react-native processes and try it again.
